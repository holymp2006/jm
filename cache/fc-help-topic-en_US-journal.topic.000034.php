The Journal Manager creates an announcement by selecting the announcement type (if any), indicating a title for the announcement, and providing both a short description and a full description of the announcement. The short description text is displayed to readers as a summary of the announcement, whereas the full description text is displayed when readers select to read the full announcement details.
